Final submission of Devadharshini (dayyapp):

There are 2 themes in this game: ocean based and then space based. 

Ocean based: you are the aquaman and then krakens and seamonsters are the bad people to killed.
Space based: you are the spaceship and the aliens are the bad people to be killed. The color of the aliens and the spaceship keeps changing here.

This is a fun game and there is no scoring implemented. 

-> for the resources I used opengameart.org and also chatgpt to some extend.
