# Galaxian Game

## Overview
This project is a 3D version of the classic **Galaxian** game, built using **WebGL** and **GLSL**. The goal of this assignment was to apply fundamental concepts of WebGL and computer graphics to create an engaging and functional game. Players control a spaceship to combat waves of alien enemies in a retro arcade-style experience.

## Features
The game includes the following features:
1. **Spaceship and Enemy Aliens**:
   - A 3D player's spaceship and at least 12 enemy aliens are displayed using perspective projection.
2. **Spaceship Animation**:
   - The spaceship moves left and right across the screen when the player presses the arrow keys.
3. **Enemy Alien Animation**:
   - Enemy aliens march left and right and occasionally descend with sinusoidal motion.
4. **Spaceship Shots and Enemy Projectiles**:
   - Players shoot projectiles to destroy aliens, while descending aliens shoot projectiles aimed at the spaceship.
5. **Collision Detection**:
   - The game ends when the spaceship collides with an alien or is hit by a projectile.

## Gameplay
- **Objective**: Destroy as many enemy aliens as possible while avoiding collisions and projectiles.
- **Controls**:
  - Left/Right Arrow Keys: Move the spaceship horizontally.
  - Space Bar: Shoot a projectile straight upward.

## Development Highlights
### Personalization
To make the game unique, I added:
- Randomized alien descent patterns for a more engaging experience.
- 2 themes - aquaman and spaceship based

## Technical Details
- **Technology Used**:
  - **WebGL**: For rendering 3D models and animations.
  - **GLSL**: For custom shaders and effects.
  - **JavaScript**: For game logic and interactivity.

- **Perspective Projection**:
  - The game uses a perspective projection to create a sense of depth with foreshortening effects.
